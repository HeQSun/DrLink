# DrLink
Detecting recombination breakpoints using Linked read sequencing

These are the source codes supporting the analysis in [Sun and Rowan et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/30/484022). 

Please refer to *INSTALL* for compiling. The current compilations have been successfully tested on Linux (arch: x_86_64, with g++ version Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1 and *R* version 3.5.1).

Please start with *DrLink_pipeline.sh* (step by step) to perform recombinant molecule prediction with 10X linked-reads.
